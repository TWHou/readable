# Readable: A Reddit Clone App

Readable is a simple single page app built on the react/redux front-end framework. Users will be able to post and comment on posts. Users can vote, edit, and delete posts and comments.

This project was built as an assignment for the Udacity React nanodegree.
The server code of this project is provided by Udacity, with a single line of code change by me (noted in the server README).

## Local Deployment Instruction
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the root of the app (where `package.json` is located).
3. Start backend server:
    1. `cd server`.
    2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
    3. Run `node server` to start the server.
    4. The server should now be running on `localhost:5001`.
4. Start frontend server (in a separate terminal window).
    1. At the root directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    2. Run `npm start` to start the react-scripts server.
    3. The app should now be running on `localhost:3000`.
